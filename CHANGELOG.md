### Changes in OSPRay Studio v0.10.0

-   Compatible with OSPRay release v2.9.0

- Features and Improvements
  - UI
    - Improved color picker widget so that color value are consistent whether
      viewing frame as sRGB or linear.
    - Added widget to change file selection on HDRI textures and photometric lights
    - Added renderer setting to set and adjust OSPRay's shadowCatcherPlane
  - Light
    - Add support for new OSPRay `cylinder` light-type
    - Photometric intensity distribution now supported on point, quad, and spot
      light types.
    - Lights in glTF scene are now instanced and can be used with motion blur
  - Camera
    - Custom support for "panoramic" camera type in glTF files
    - All glTF cameras are instanced to allow for motion blur
  - Batch
    - Improved batch rendering flexibility with params for cameraType, bgColor,
      frameStep and denoiser.
    - Added final frame denoising to batch mode - only final accumulation is
      denoised.
  - Added glTF support for OSPRay's new multi-segment deformation motion blur
  - Added python bindings for affine3f and affine3f::translate
  - Added tasking/scheduling system.  Currently used to greatly improve loading
    of raw volumes.  Will be expanded to other asynchronous operations.

<br>

- Bug Fixes:
  - Fixed lights editor interaction with group lights loaded in a glTF file.  UI
    now allows correct editing/removal of existing lights and addition new lights
  - Added full path name and extension to importer and texture cache entried to
    prevent collision with similar files.
  - Better handling of failed texture load across glTF and OBJ materials, as well
    as HDRI, background texture, and material editor.
  - Correctly enable to/from_json for LinearSpace2f texture transform
  - Improved saving of multi-layer EXR images

### Changes in OSPRay Studio v0.9.1

  - Enabled alternate camera selection in glTF scenes
  - Added ability for python scripts to define transfer functions and load Studio plugins
  - Enabled .sg scene files can now contain an HDRI light
  - Much improved command line parsing in all modes
  - Added support for several new KHR_materials extensions
    (`KHR_materials_volume`, `KHR_materials_specular`, `KHR_materials_ior`)
    and  `KHR_texture_transform`
  - Improved UI controls for adjusting model transforms
<br>

- Bug Fixes:
  - Fixed high-DPI display issues
  - Fixed bug causing model textures to be flipped if loading HDRI first

    -   New transfer functions and color maps for volume rendering
    -   Much improved search widget for scene objects and materials
    -   Large scene performance optimization

    -   Updated external 3rd party dependencies bringing in features and bug fixes
    -   Modified OBJ importer to parse and use quads and triangles
    -   Improved Arcball camera navigation with up-vector lock
<br>

-   Bug Fixes
    -   Fixed materials after clearing scene
    -   Fixed materials for PointCloudData (PCD)
