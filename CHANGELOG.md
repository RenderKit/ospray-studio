### Changes in OSPRay Studio v1.2.0

- Compatible with OSPRay release v3.3.0


### Changes in OSPRay Studio v1.1.0

- Compatible with OSPRay release v3.2.0

- Features and Improvements
  - Add support for new OSPRay functionality:<br>
    - Blue noise sampling enabled through setting `accumLimit`
    - Tonemapper post-process adjustments without re-rendering
    - OpenImageDenoise quality settings and denoise alpha channel through UI and
      new command line parameters:
      - "--denoiseQuality" {low, medium, high} sets the final frame quality
      - "--denoiseAlpha" enables denoising the alpha channel
    - Half-float texture format supported for EXR textures
    - Support for new OSPRay param `limitIndirectLightSamples` optimization
      which limits the number of light samples after the first non-specular
     (i.e., diffuse and glossy) bounce to at most one.

    highly instanced scenes.
<br><br>

- Cleanup and bug fixes:
  - Fixes for glTF PBR materials:<br>
    - normal channel, previously used default normal
      that affects all layers, including coat.  Now baseNormal and coatNormal
      are considered separately.
    - `sheenColorTexture` parameter was not applied correctly
    - Removed `thicknessTexture` from KHR_materials_volume to allow ray-depth
      to determine thickness.
  - Fix verify install condition to report ospInit errors correctly
  - Update 3rd party dependencies

  - Add more OSPRay material types to UI, supporting the rest of
    the OSPRay material types and their default values.
  - Support for both OpenEXR v2.x and v3.x APIs
  - Detection of asynchronous file modifications for automatic
    update HDRI and backplate textures.
  - Enable plugins to access MainWindow class, re-enabling plugins to access

  - Graceful exit if command line parsing fails
  - Fix support for 2D measured light intensity distribution

### Changes in OSPRay Studio v0.13.0

-   Compatible with OSPRay release v3.0.0

- Features and Improvements
  - OSPRay v3 Compatibility:<br>
    - Intel Xe GPU beta support: launch Studio with parameters
      `--osp:load-modules=gpu --osp:device=gpu`
    - Add OSPRay v3 enum compatibility, tightened type-checking on all enum usage
    - Add OSPRay v3 enum type comprehension to json for .sg files<br>
      **(Note: This change will break existing .sg files.  The most
      common parameter is "intensityQuantity", which previously had
      a subType of "uchar" and needs to change to
      "OSPIntensityQuantity".)**
  - Texture Formats:  Support for .exr and .tiff image formats by
    default though inclusion of tinyexr and tinydng 3rd party header-only
    libraries.  OpenImageIO is still available as a build option.
  - Convert glTF light intensity from lux to watts.  glTF specifies intensity
    in lux, OSPRay in watts.  Convert to watts for compatibility with glTF
    exporters.
  - Add default HDRI map, used when no other map is present.  OSPRay used to
    crash when removing HDRI map from light or when texture would fail to load.
    Automatically switches to this default map now.
  - Fix UI "pick focus distance"
    - Left-Shift+left-mouse sets pick-point to center-of-screen,
      center-of-arcball
    - Left-Crl-Shift+left-mouse sets pick-point to focus distance without
      moving center of arcball
  - More intuitive behavior around Search All actions vs selected actions
  - Transform editor now enables traversing selected node's parents
  - Minor cleanup/refactor of GenerateImGuiWidgets
  - Prevent filename widget collisions:
    If there were multiple filename widgets visible, they would all
      receive the file list returned by fileBrowser.
  - Enable OpenImageDenoise in python bindings and python tutorial scripts
  - Add ability to reload Assets rather than just instance
  - Cameras loaded by assets now add to scene cameras rather than replacing
  - Expose selectCamera to StudioContext, callable by plugins
  - Enable parsing of general texture.transform in mtl files, was limited to
    individual rotation, scale and translation
<br><br>

- Cleanup and bug fixes:
  - Prevent nullptr dereference on deleted importer assets
  - Fix sporadic crash SearchWidget when search term had no match
  - Use custom deleter for pre-C++17 compatability
  - Resolve incorrect delete usage in Texture2D
  - Fix addLight to update existing light parameters.
    If addLight is called with an existing light, it was returning immediately.
    It should update the light parameters with that of the new light.
  - Be more careful about adding unique names in glTF importer.
    When a node, light, or camera name is unclear a unique number is added to
    the name.  Importer was accidentally doing this twice or adding unique
    number to already unique names.

### Changes in OSPRay Studio v0.11.0

-   Compatible with OSPRay release v2.10.0

- Note! The background color now defaults to black.  It is left to the user to
